Shinkansen Travel Experience - This project was based on the Shinkansen Bullet Train in Japan, and passengers experiences with that mode of travel. This machine learning problem aims to determine the relative importance of each parameter with regards to their contribution to the passengers overall travel experience.

The goal of the project was to predict whether a passenger was satisfied or not considering his/her overall experience of traveling on the Shinkansen Bullet Train. This project was part of the 2022 Hackaton hosted by MIT IDSS.
